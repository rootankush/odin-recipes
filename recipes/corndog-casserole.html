        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This cheesy corndog casserole has the comforting flavors of a corndog with far less effort. Hot dogs, cheese, and corn bread mix combine in an easy casserole.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>3/4 cup chopped green onion</li>
            <li>8 hot dogs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages corn bread mix, such as Jiffy®</li>
            <li>8 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Grease a 3-quart baking dish. </li>
            <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add celery and onions and cook until softened, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl. </li>
            <li>Add hot dog pieces to the same skillet and cook until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to mixing bowl with veggies. </li>
            <li>Add in milk, eggs, mustard, hot sauce, cornbread mix, and 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese; stir until combined (it’s ok if some lumps remain). Pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle any remaining cheese on top. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, 25 to 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted near the center should come out fairly clean. Let stand 5 to 10 minutes before serving. </li>
        </ol>
