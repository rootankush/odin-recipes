        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 cups coarsely shredded zucchini</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Chedder cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2/3 cup italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>chopped chives to taste, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2-quart rectangular baking dish.</li>
            <li>Combine zucchini and salt in a large bowl and toss to coat evenly. Transfer zucchini to a colander set in the sink. Let stand to drain excess moisture, 15 minutes. Transfer zucchini to a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out any remaining liquid. Use paper towels to wipe the large bowl dry.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Whisk together eggs and pepper in the large bowl. Add zucchini, onion mixture, mozzarella, Cheddar, and 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese; combine thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and spread into an even layer.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, combine panko and melted butter in a small bowl. Stir in remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Top casserole with breadcrumb mixture and bake until golden and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Garnish with chives.</li>
        </ol>
